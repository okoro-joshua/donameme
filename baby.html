                    They say children are gift from God and a baby is as innocent as it goes.
                    This is a a picture of an innocent baby boy who was found by our team at one of the fallen buildings.
                    it was indeed a painful pitiful sight but we love all little children of the world, so we took him and named him jude and he is 4 months old. 
                    we need support to take very good care of him as we are trying our best to give him the best he need to become a full grown up adult.
